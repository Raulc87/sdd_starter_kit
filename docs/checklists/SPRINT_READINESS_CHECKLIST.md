# SPRINT READINESS CHECKLIST

Run this checklist before starting any sprint. Record the result in the sprint plan's "Entry Gates" section. Any unchecked item marked **(blocking)** prevents the sprint from starting.

## 1. Repository and bootstrap
- [ ] **(blocking)** Every path listed in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` exists.
- [ ] **(blocking)** `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are present and match the Starter Kit version (or differences are intentional and documented).
- [ ] `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` has the repository URL, status, and active sprint filled in.
- [ ] `README.md` status matches `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
- [ ] **(blocking)** The project key is defined in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, and the sprint plan lists the planned branch name for each story (naming rules in `AGENTS.md`).

## 2. Documentation consistency
- [ ] **(blocking)** Spec, user stories, UX direction, tech stack, plan, and sprint plan agree on scope, field names, and behavior.
- [ ] Data field naming convention is stated and used consistently (e.g. `snake_case`).
- [ ] Supported languages/locales are stated (and how the language is chosen).
- [ ] Every functional requirement maps to at least one user story.

## 3. User stories
- [ ] **(blocking)** Every sprint story has testable acceptance criteria (no undefined terms such as "common widths" or "graceful" without a definition).
- [ ] Every story has an owner in the sprint plan.

## 4. Contracts and integrations
- [ ] **(blocking)** Every interface shared between workstreams has a locked contract: path, method, content type, request fields with types and validation rules, response shape, status codes, error codes, server-generated fields (formats, timezone), configuration variables.
- [ ] Each external integration has a documented failure behavior and fallback.
- [ ] Credentials: owner, storage location, and "never in Git / never client-side" rule are stated.

## 5. Data, legal, and security
- [ ] **(blocking)** If personal data is collected: jurisdiction, consent mechanism, and privacy notice are decided.
- [ ] Abuse/spam protection is either in scope or tracked as a story with a "before public launch" condition.

## 6. Stack and environment
- [ ] Hosting runtime capabilities are confirmed, or an ADR records the assumption and a fallback.
- [ ] Local development/demo environment is defined (how to run the full flow locally).
- [ ] Test tools, lint tools, and CI checks are named.

## 7. Parallelization
- [ ] **(blocking)** Workstreams are assigned (max 3 implementation agents).
- [ ] **(blocking)** A file/directory ownership map exists in the sprint plan.
- [ ] Foundation/scaffold work and its owner are identified and sequenced before parallel work.
- [ ] Merge order and the integration PR owner are defined.
- [ ] Conflict-resolution rule is stated.

## 7.1 Merge control
- [ ] **(blocking)** Every agent prompt states that agents never merge or approve PRs; only the human owner merges after approval (`AGENTS.md`).
- [ ] `main` is protected in GitHub (pull request required, no force pushes or deletions).

## 8. Go-ahead
- [ ] **(blocking)** The human owner has given explicit go-ahead.
